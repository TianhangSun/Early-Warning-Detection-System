# Early-Warning-Detection-System
Early warning detection system for solar power. The software could do automatic real-time analysis and visualization of the data collected from wireless sensor networks, and predict the cloud moving direction, estimate solar power drop and when the cloud will arrive at the solar panel array location on MSU campus. The project needs the prototype setup to run, prototype requires WI-FI capable microcontroller, several light sensors, and a board the simulate the cloud, and user needs to modify the setup in software to match the real setup. Implemented for course project, not intended for production use.
